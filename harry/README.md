# Hogwarts Quests - Assignment 2
1. You are tracking the distance to the Hogwarts Express. A magical instrument reports it’s 100 leagues away. Before the reading, your belief about
the distance D was a Gaussian D ∼ N(µ = 98, σ2 = 16). The instrument’s
reading is the true distance plus Gaussian noise (N(0, 4)).
- a. What is the PDF of your prior belief of the train’s true distance?
- b. What is the probability density of seeing a reading of 100 leagues, given
the true distance is t?
- c. What is the PDF of your posterior belief (after the reading) of the
train’s true distance? (You can leave a constant and don’t need to
simplify).
