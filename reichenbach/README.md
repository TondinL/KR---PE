## Written Problems:
### 1. The Seating of the Diogenes Club

Sherlock Holmes investigates a clandestine meeting at the Diogenes Club, where 10 distinct members must sit in a row under strict protocols:
- a. If no rules bind their arrangement, how many ways can the silent gentlemen be seated?
- b. Suppose Mycroft Holmes and his aide, bound by mutual distrust, must sit side-by-side to monitor each other—how many arrangements are possible?
- c. If 5 are seasoned inspectors and 5 are novice constables, and no two of the same rank may sit adjacent (lest rivalries flare), how many seating orders hold?
- d. If the 10 form 5 pairs of informants and handlers, each pair inseparable due to whispered secrets, how many arrangements emerge?
Deduction: Explain your reasoning as if briefing Watson on the club’s hidden hierarchy.
